			<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt><b>What is a yurt?</b></dt>
				<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.  Each yurt is fully enclosed<br>
				with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
				<dt><b>How are the yurts furnished?</b></dt>
				<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.  Your luxury camping<br>
				experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.  Shower and restroom facilities<br>
				are located in the lodge.</dd>
				<dt><b>What should I bring?</b></dt>
				<dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.<br>
				It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
